ViniPlay transforms your M3U and EPG files into a polished, high-performance streaming experience. It's a full-featured IPTV solution that runs in a Docker container, providing a robust Node.js backend to handle streams and a sleek, responsive frontend for an exceptional user experience.

The server-side backend resolves common CORS and browser compatibility issues by proxying or transcoding streams with FFMPEG, while the feature-rich frontend provides a user experience comparable to premium IPTV services.

## ✨ Features

 - 👤 **Multi-User Management**: Secure the application with a dedicated admin account. Create, edit, and manage standard user accounts.
 - 📺 **Modern TV Guide**: A high-performance, virtualized EPG grid that handles thousands of channels and programs smoothly. Features include advanced search, channel favoriting, and a "Recents" category.
 - 🖼️ **Multi-View**: Drag, drop, and resize players on a grid to watch multiple streams simultaneously. Save and load custom layouts. "Immersive view" will hide all UI elements and only leave the players on the page to maximize the watching experience.
 - 🛜 **Chromecast Support**: Cast your streams directly to any Google Cast-enabled device on your network. (This will only work if your source signal is strong and correctly passed without package missing, due to Cast framework)
 - 🔔 **Push Notifications**: Set reminders for upcoming programs and receive push notifications in your browser, even when the app is closed.
 - ⚙️ **Powerful Transcoding - even with GPUs**: The backend uses FFMPEG to process streams, ensuring compatibility across all modern browsers and devices. Create custom stream profiles to tailor transcoding settings. GPU transcoding supported. (Nvidia, InterlQSV and Vaapi)
 - 📂 **Flexible Source Management**: Add M3U and EPG sources from either local files, XC code and remote URLs. Set automatic refresh intervals for URL-based sources to keep your guide data fresh.
 - 🚀 **High Performance UI**: The frontend is built with performance in mind, using UI virtualization for the guide and efficient state management to ensure a fast and responsive experience.
 - 🐳 **Dockerized Deployment**: The entire application is packaged in a single Docker container for simple, one-command deployment using Docker or Docker Compose.
 - ▶️ **Picture-in-Picture**: Pop out the player to keep watching while you work on other things.
 - 🎥 **DVR**: Record programs using FFMPEG. Schedule recording via the TV Guide, or set specific channels and time with ease.
 - 📽️ **Single player**: Play .m3u8 and .ts links directly from the browser, with detailed console logs and recorded history
 - 👥 **Admin monitoring page**: Monitor users watch stream in real time, store historical plays, and broadcast messages to all users.

## 🚀 Getting Started

ViniPlay is designed for easy deployment using Docker.

### Prerequisites

-   Docker
-   Docker Compose (Recommended)
    
### Method 1: Using `docker-compose` (Recommended)

1.  **Create Project Files:** Create a directory for your ViniPlay setup and add a `docker-compose.yml` and a `.env` file.
    
    -   `docker-compose.yml`:
        
        ```
        version: "3.8"
        services:
          viniplay:
            image: ardovini/viniplay:latest
            container_name: viniplay
            ports:
              - "8998:8998"
            restart: unless-stopped
            volumes:
              - ./viniplay-data:/data
            env_file:
              - ./.env
        
        ```
        
    -   `.env`:
        
        ```
        # Replace this with a long, random, and secret string
        SESSION_SECRET=your_super_secret_session_key_here
        
        ```
        
        > **Security Note:** Your `SESSION_SECRET` should be a long, random string to properly secure user sessions.
    
2.  **Build and Run the Container:**
    
    ```
    docker-compose up --build -d
    
    ```

### Method 2: Using `docker`

1.  **Build the Image:**
    
    ```
    docker build -t viniplay .
    
    ```
    
2.  **Run the Container:** Create a volume directory (`mkdir viniplay-data`) and a `.env` file first. Then run the container:
    
    ```
    docker run -d \
      -p 8998:8998 \
      --name viniplay \
      --env-file ./.env \
      -v "$(pwd)/viniplay-data":/data \
      viniplay
    
    ```
    
### First-Time Setup

Once the container is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8998`. You will be prompted to create your initial **admin account**. After creating the admin account, you can log in and start configuring your sources in the **Settings** tab.

---
## 🔧 Configuration

All configuration is done via the web interface in the **Settings** tab.

-   **Data Sources:** Add your M3U and EPG sources from remote URLs, XC Codes, uploaded files.
-   **Processing:** After adding sources, click the **Process Sources & View Guide** button to download, parse, and merge all your data.
-   **Player Settings:** Manage User-Agent strings and define `ffmpeg` stream profiles.
-   **User Management (Admin):** Admins can create, edit, and delete user accounts.
